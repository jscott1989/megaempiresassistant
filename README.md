# Mega Empires Assistant

The goal of this project is to make it easier and faster to
play [Eastern Empires](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/338980/eastern-empires),
[Western Empires](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/267304/western-empires),
and [Mega Empires](https://mega-empires.com).

We achieve this by automating as much of the admin work as possible, allowing players to focus on
the meaningful choices.

Currently we support:

* Calculating the total value of held trade goods
* Calculating the cost of advances
* Calculating the effect of calamities
* Enforcing hand limits

In future we intend to support:

* Summarising relevant rules for the current phase given current game state
* Prompting for AST progress
* Calculating the result of combat

This is available on Android or [on the web](http://megaempires.jscott.me).
