For example, if you hold the 'Mining' advance then the value of your treasury tokens is automatically counted as double, you don't need to do anything manual to make this happen.\n\nMandatory credits are automatically applied and are visible on the credits screen. You may edit the credits on top of that for your own purposes.\n\nYou can use the 'Calamities' menu to show the effect of each calamity on you given the current state of your advances. Again, this will automatically account for advances which make calamities better or worse for you.\n\n\n\n\n",
